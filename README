Requirements
============

To run JSampler you need Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 5 or higher.

To build a distribution you need JDK version 5.0 or higher
and the Ant tool (http://ant.apache.org/).


Distributions
=============

All available distributions are located in the dist directory.


Compilation
===========

To build a JSampler distribution follow the next steps.
(there are two distribution available for now - JS Classic and Fantasia)

  1. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK directory.
     If the JDK is installed in /opt/jdk1.5.0 directory, this can be done
     by issuing the following command:

     export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.5.0

     (Windows users should do something like `set JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.5.0')

  2. Choose one or more of the following options.

     - Building a JS Classic distribution: `ant build-jsclassic'

     - Cleaning the JS Classic distribution: `ant clean-jsclassic'

     - Building a Fantasia distribution: `ant build-fantasia'

     - Cleaning the Fantasia distribution: `ant clean-fantasia'


Installation
============

Copy the desired file (dist/js-classic.jar or dist/fantasia.jar)
to some location. That's it!

You may also consider using a script for running particular distribution.
Look at scripts directory to find an appropriate script for that.


Running
=======

On some systems double clicking on the jar file will be enough.
If you aren't that lucky use the following
commands to run JS Classic or Fantasia:

java -jar /<path-to-js-classic>/js-classic.jar
java -jar /<path-to-fantasia>/fantasia.jar

If the java command is not in your path, locate your jre directory and type:

/<jre-dir>/bin/java -jar /<path-to-js-classic>/js-classic.jar
/<jre-dir>/bin/java -jar /<path-to-fantasia>/fantasia.jar

Note that you must run LinuxSampler before running a JSampler frontend.
